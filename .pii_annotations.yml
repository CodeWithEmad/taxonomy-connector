# Local models are all fully annotated, but non-local models are not annotated
# because this repo does not contain an IDA/Django project (which, according to
# our own PII annotating policy, doesn't require non-local annotations).  88.9%
# coverage represents all local models, and is the current theoretical maximum
# coverage.
